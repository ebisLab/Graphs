I will start out  with the smallest map to make sure my traversal works
im thinking of having a util file with queue and stack available
maybe a traversal BFS as we don't have anything we are actively seeking out
possible game plan:
    1) populate graph by traversing through all the rooms
    2) keep track of rooms with directions
    3) call populate graph function (populate_graph())
    4) when length of visited is less than number of rooms:
        - find a path
        - traverse the returned list of moves
        -update current room





graph ={
    0: [(3,1), {'n':1}],
    1: [(3,2, {'i':1, 'n':2} )]
    2: [(3,5), {'n': 1} ]
}

graph[roomid] = list contains dictionary and the reference number to the current roomid

re

return current room id 
    player current room id

return current room exit 
    player curent room 

move player in visited path
path

player travel path
